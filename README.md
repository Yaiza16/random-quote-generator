## Overview

  

![Gif for the random quote generator](./result/random-quote-generator.gif)



## Features
That is my first project using `React`. Although my main idea was to replicate the original challenge, as long as I was advancing with the app, some new features came to my mind so, I couldn't stop myself from setting them up.

-   I added an input to do queries. You can do text search query or author search query
-   I added pagination so you can see all quotes written by the author (or all search queries)

I wanted to focus on functional components and practice on that, so the app style doesn't exactly look like the design.

Spinner loader is from [loading.io](https://loading.io/css)

### Built With
-  React
- Webpack
